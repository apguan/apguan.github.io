        <p>Pride is a hackathon project built at HackDavis 2016 to help Teach for America tackle the challenge teachers face when creating lesson plans. It uses IBM's Watson to help parse through data and allows teachers to give feedback to one another. The build wasn't all buttery smooth though! We had some challenges along the way. Originally, we wanted to create the project using a MEAN stack because of all the CRUD operations (no one on the team had done this before). Eventually, we decided we would figure it out some other time, and build the front-end with static HTML and the back-end with Python. In the end won not only Best Education Tool, but also Best Use of Cisco Spark at HackDavis.

            <span><b>Now What?</b></span>
            <p>Currently, we are revamping the project to entirely use a MEAN stack. The goal is to create and open-source app to help teachers provide the best learning experience possible. Learning Angular.js and Node.js in the short months has been challenging but super fun!

        <p>So this is more of a personal project that I'm excited to share. Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted a motorized longboard. In the 90's people generally mounted lawnmower engines onto big chunky-wheeled longboards. They were impractical, and terribly loud for commuting. Now, with high-powered brushless motors, it's easier than ever to mount an electric motor onto a longboard. It was definitely a learning process. What's this all have to do with coding? Using a Wii-mote controller and an Arduino as a bluetooth receiver for the electronic speed controller (ESC), you can hack a way to make a sleek wireless RC controller. The benefits mean a fully customized ESC that can sense changes in terrain and adjusting for power automatically. The instructions were written in Python, a first for me, but most definitely not the last time (working on getting better). Other than coding, I had to figure out how to wire multiple li-po batteries, and build the deck using composites.

        <div class="now-what">
            <span><b>Now What?</b></span>
            <p>A limitation of most electric longboards is they're either one-wheel-drive or two-wheel-drive, but only on one side of the board (usually the back). This means traction could be an issue when wet. Why not mount torsen limited-slip-differentials (LSD)? The theory behind a torsen LSD is to use a combination of gears to split the torque to the wheels. The best part is the wheel with the most amount of grip would receive the most torque. This would be great, to be able to split the power of one motor between two wheels, but why not double that and create a highly efficient all-wheel-drive electric longboard??

  <h1>Some Other Projects</h1>
    <p>Below are some examples of projects I've done for fun! They're the projects I've worked on to learn the basics while experimenting with new coding methods. Like the saying goes...there's no better way than to just do!
